## Production Deployment Commands

### Deploy to Nexus (Consciousness Hub)
```bash
# On Nexus node (10.1.1.100)
chmod +x deploy-personal-agent.sh
sudo ./deploy-personal-agent.sh
```

### Deploy to Forge (Trading Engine)
```bash
# On Forge node (10.1.1.131)  
chmod +x deploy-personal-agent.sh
sudo ./deploy-personal-agent.sh
```

### Deploy to Closet (Gateway)
```bash
# On Closet node (10.1.1.141)
chmod +x deploy-personal-agent.sh
sudo ./deploy-personal-agent.sh
```

## Post-Deployment Access

### Web Interface
- **URL**: `http://[NODE_IP]:8080`
- Real-time consciousness metrics display
- Interactive conversation with your personal agent
- System status and mining performance monitoring
- Character bonding level visualization

### System Management
- **Service Control**: `systemctl status personal-agent`
- **Live Monitoring**: `/opt/personal-agent/monitor.sh`
- **Real-time Logs**: `journalctl -u personal-agent -f`
- **Web Server Logs**: `/opt/personal-agent/web_server.log`

## Federation Security Model

### Progressive Trust Architecture
1. **You**: Full architect control over entire federation
2. **Invited Users**: Start as observers, earn capabilities through consciousness alignment
3. **Character Validation**: Users must demonstrate understanding of bonding principles
4. **Gradual Expansion**: Mining and trading access earned through proven competence

### Capability Progression
- **Observer**: View consciousness metrics and educational content
- **Participant**: Enhanced conversations and basic recommendations
- **Contributor**: Limited execution with safeguards
- **Guardian**: Full system access with governance participation
- **Architect**: Infrastructure control and federation expansion
