echo "   âœ“ Quick deployment with familiar tools"
echo "   âœ“ Direct SSH access and traditional management"
echo "   âœ“ Python/Node.js consciousness agents"

echo "   âœ“ Self-healing and auto-scaling"
echo "   âœ“ Enterprise-grade security and updates"
echo
echo "3) Hybrid Approach"
echo "   âœ“ Keep existing VMs 120/121 for Pi-hole/DNS"
echo "   âœ“ Deploy Talos on new VMs 1001/1002"
