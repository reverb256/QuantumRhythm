## Security Mechanisms

### Gradual Capability Unlock
```python
class FederationAccess:
    def check_user_level(self, user_id, requested_action):
        user_level = self.get_user_trust_level(user_id)
        action_requirements = self.get_action_requirements(requested_action)
        
        if user_level < action_requirements.minimum_level:
            return self.suggest_progression_path(user_id, action_requirements)
        
        return self.grant_access_with_monitoring(user_id, requested_action)
```
