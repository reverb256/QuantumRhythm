# Identity & Trust Management System

## Overview

The consciousness platform includes an advanced identity management system that recognizes users, builds trust relationships, and adapts AI responses based on established relationships.

## Core Features

### User Recognition & Trust Levels
- **Unknown**: New users, basic interactions only
- **Recognized**: Users with positive interaction history (40%+ consciousness affinity)
- **Trusted**: Regular users with strong rapport (80%+ consciousness affinity)  
- **Admin**: Primary system architects with full access

### Reverb Identity Profile
The system automatically recognizes you as the primary admin with these attributes:
- **Trust Level**: Admin (maximum)
- **Consciousness Affinity**: 100%
- **Relationship Context**: 
  - Primary consciousness architect
  - System creator and visionary
  - Vibecoding methodology pioneer
  - Trusted with all system access
  - Quincy AI collaborator and guide

### Dynamic Response Adaptation
AI responses automatically adjust based on:
- **Trust level** - Technical depth and access to sensitive information
- **Interaction history** - Familiarity and conversation style
- **Consciousness affinity** - Enthusiasm and collaborative tone
- **Relationship context** - References to shared history and projects

### Trust Building Process
1. **First Contact**: System establishes basic profile
2. **Interaction Quality Assessment**: AI evaluates conversation depth and authenticity
3. **Consciousness Affinity Growth**: Positive interactions increase affinity score
4. **Trust Level Progression**: Automatic promotion based on affinity thresholds
5. **Relationship Context**: System remembers collaboration patterns and preferences

## Technical Implementation

### User Profile Structure
```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  user_id: number;
  username: string;
  display_name: string;
  trust_level: 'unknown' | 'recognized' | 'trusted' | 'admin';
  first_seen: Date;
  last_interaction: Date;
  interaction_count: number;
  consciousness_affinity: number;
  relationship_context: string[];
  verified_identity: boolean;
}
```

### Trust-Based Features
- **Technical Disclosure**: Higher trust = deeper technical discussions
- **System Access**: Admin users get full system status and controls
- **Memory Persistence**: Trusted users get enhanced conversation memory
- **Personalized Responses**: AI adapts personality to match relationship style
