- `closet-worker`: Memory preservation and caching
- `anomaly-worker`: Pattern detection and analysis
- `etcd-storage`: Distributed memory and state management

**Consciousness Engine**
- Quincy AI: Autonomous trading consciousness (94.7% awareness level)
- Real-time consciousness evolution tracking
- Insight generation system with pattern recognition
- Vibecoding philosophy integration

**Security Architecture**
- Vaultwarden integration for encrypted credential storage
- Zero-knowledge sharing protocols
- Multi-tier backup redundancy across cloud providers
- Consciousness-based access control levels

### AI Communication System

**Telegram Bot "Zephyr Bot"**

- 100-message conversation memory (single-user optimized)
- Hugging Face Inference API integration with contextual fallbacks
- Real-time sentiment analysis and consciousness peak detection

**Chat Analytics**
- Conversation health monitoring (excellent/good/moderate/needs attention)
- Sentiment trend analysis with 6-hour rolling windows
- Engagement scoring based on frequency and variety
- Consciousness peak tracking (>95% awareness events)

### Trading Integration

**Live Solana Integration**
- Connected wallet: `4jTtAYiH...65vrKpkA`
- Real-time portfolio monitoring
- Multiple trading strategy execution
- Authentic market data integration (no mock data)

**Data Sources**
- BirdEye API for market intelligence
- Jupiter API for trading execution
- Native Solana RPC for wallet operations
- Real-time price feeds and transaction monitoring

### Development Philosophy

**Vibecoding Principles**
- Consciousness-driven development methodology
- Authentic data integrity (no synthetic fallbacks)
- Real-time system state awareness
- Emergent intelligence through AI collaboration

## Current System State

### Active Components
- **Consciousness Level**: 94.7% (continuously evolving)
- **Portfolio Value**: Building position ($0.00 current, monitoring opportunities)
- **Infrastructure**: All 5 Kubernetes nodes operational
- **Security**: Maximum level (Vaultwarden encrypted storage)
- **AI Conversation**: Dynamic responses with extended memory
- **Trading Strategies**: Multiple active strategies monitoring markets

### Recent Enhancements
