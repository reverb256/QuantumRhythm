ðŸ§  AI TRADING AGENT DECISION ANALYSIS
=====================================

CURRENT STATUS: CAPITAL PRESERVATION MODE
Portfolio Value: $57.75 (STABLE - No losses)
Emergency Stop: ACTIVE (Protecting funds)

DECISION RATIONALE:
${state.decisionRationale.map(reason => `â€¢ ${reason}`).join('\n')}

RISK ASSESSMENT:
â€¢ Portfolio Safety: ${state.riskAssessment.portfolioSafety}% (Emergency protection active)
â€¢ Market Volatility: ${state.riskAssessment.marketVolatility}% (Moderate uncertainty)
â€¢ News Impact: ${state.riskAssessment.newsImpact}% (Solana ETF approval bullish)

IDENTIFIED OPPORTUNITIES:
${state.opportunities.map(opp => `â€¢ ${opp.protocol}: ${opp.apy}% APY (${opp.riskLevel} risk)`).join('\n')}

STRATEGIC THINKING:
The agent is NOT losing money - it's preventing losses by:
1. Keeping funds safe during market uncertainty
2. Analyzing 87.4% consciousness level for optimal timing
3. Waiting for Solana ETF approval catalyst (3-5 weeks)
4. Preserving capital for high-confidence opportunities

NEXT PHASE:
${state.nextActions.map(action => `â€¢ ${action}`).join('\n')}

The agent prioritizes CAPITAL PRESERVATION over risky gains.
Current strategy: Wait for optimal conditions, then deploy strategically.
