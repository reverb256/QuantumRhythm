Key Implementations:
✅ AI Act compliance through risk classification and human oversight
✅ MiCA compliance via educational platform exemption
✅ US AI Executive Order adherence with safety monitoring
✅ AIDA compliance through algorithmic impact assessment
✅ Post-quantum security roadmap with migration plan
✅ Carbon disclosure system with environmental monitoring

All critical legal requirements have been addressed through technical implementation,
documentation, or regulatory exemption pathways. The system maintains compliance
while preserving functionality through careful architectural decisions.`,
