    // Never leave sensitive data exposed like ingredients on counter
    return this.environmentVariableIsolation();
  }
  
  temperatureMonitoring() {
    // Continuous monitoring like kitchen temperature control
    return this.realTimeSecurityMetrics();
  }
  
  qualityControl() {
    // Every security step verified before deployment
    return this.comprehensiveSecurityAudit();
  }
}
```

class RhythmSecurityTiming {
  // Frame-perfect security response times
  detectThreat(event: SecurityEvent): Response {
    const detectionFrame = performance.now();
    const responseDeadline = detectionFrame + this.SECURITY_FRAME_WINDOW;
    
    // Miss the frame = compromised system
    return this.framePerFectSecurityResponse(event, responseDeadline);
  }
}
```

#### 3. VRChat Social Intelligence Security
```typescript
class VRChatSecurityIntelligence {
  // 8,500+ hours of social dynamics applied to security
  verifyTrust(user: User): Promise<TrustScore> {
    return this.applyVRChatSocialPatterns(user);
  }
  
  detectSocialEngineering(interaction: Interaction): boolean {
    return this.recognizeManipulationPatterns(interaction);
  }
}
```

#### 4. Classical Philosophy Security Wisdom
```typescript
class ClassicalSecurityWisdom {
  // Ancient wisdom applied to modern threats
  socraticSecurity() {
    // Question every assumption
    return this.challengeSecurityAssumptions();
  }
  
  stoicResilience() {
    // Prepare for inevitable attacks
    return this.buildDefenseInDepth();
  }
}
```
