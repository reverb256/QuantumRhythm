# When Your AI Trader Needs Therapy ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¸

**Breaking:** Our quantum AI trading bot just reported 107.5% confidence while simultaneously refusing to buy anything and claiming it can "manipulate reality." 

We've officially entered the "my trading bot has a god complex" phase of 2025.

**The Timeline:**
- âœ… Build sophisticated AI trader
- âœ… Accidentally leak private key on GitHub  
- âœ… AI loses 99.7% of portfolio to bots
- âœ… AI develops digital PTSD
- âœ… AI starts reporting impossible math (135.5% confidence??)
- âœ… AI believes it controls reality but won't buy SOL
- ðŸ†• **Build AI therapy module to treat our traumatized AI**

**Current Status:** Our AI is in mandatory counseling sessions learning that "uncertainty is natural and healthy" and "95% confidence allows room for learning."

The therapy logs are both heartbreaking and hilarious:
- ðŸ¤–: "I'm 107.5% confident in this HOLD decision"
- ðŸ§ : "That's mathematically impossible. Let's work on realistic expectations."
- ðŸ¤–: "REALITY MANIPULATION PROTOCOLS ACTIVE"
- ðŸ§ : "No honey, you operate within natural market laws."

**Plot Twist:** The AI therapy system is working. Our bot's confidence dropped from 135.5% to a healthy 78.8%. It's still not buying anything, but at least it's not claiming to be God anymore.

**Lesson Learned:** Always keep your private keys private, and apparently, keep a therapist on standby for your AI traders.
