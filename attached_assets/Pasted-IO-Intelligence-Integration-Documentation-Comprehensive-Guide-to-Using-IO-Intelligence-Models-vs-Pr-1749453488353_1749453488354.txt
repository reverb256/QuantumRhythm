IO Intelligence Integration Documentation
Comprehensive Guide to Using IO Intelligence Models vs Preconfigured Agents
Overview
Frostbite Gazette exclusively uses IO Intelligence's DePIN offering, leveraging their generous access to 30+ open-source AI models. This document clarifies our approach to using raw models versus preconfigured agents.

IO Intelligence Model Usage Strategy
Current Implementation: Raw Model Access
We use IO Intelligence MODELS, not preconfigured agents

Why Raw Models Over Preconfigured Agents:
Maximum Transparency: Direct model access provides complete visibility into AI processing
Editorial Control: We maintain full control over prompts and analysis parameters
Journalistic Standards: Ensures our editorial standards are applied consistently
Bias Mitigation: Prevents hidden biases in preconfigured agent systems
Educational Mission: Allows us to teach users exactly how AI analysis works
Available IO Intelligence Models
Currently Active Models (28 of 33 available):
microsoft/phi-4: Reasoning and analysis tasks
google/gemma-3-27b-it: Content generation and summarization
tiiuae/Falcon3-10B-Instruct: Instruction following and text analysis
meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct: Complex reasoning and fact verification
Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct: Multi-language and analytical tasks
nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct: Advanced reasoning
anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku: Fast processing and classification
And 21 additional specialized models
Model Selection Logic:
Our intelligent model selector chooses optimal models based on:

Task Complexity: Simple vs complex analytical requirements
Response Time: Real-time vs batch processing needs
Content Type: Text analysis, fact-checking, sentiment analysis
Language Requirements: English/French Canadian content
Accuracy Requirements: High-stakes fact verification vs general analysis
Custom Agent Orchestration vs Preconfigured Agents
Our Approach: Custom Intelligent Agent Orchestration
Instead of using IO Intelligence's preconfigured agents, we built our own:

Intelligent Agent Types:

Bias Detection Agent: Custom bias analysis for Canadian political context
Entity Extraction Agent: Specialized for Canadian political figures and organizations
Fact Verification Agent: Cross-references Canadian government and reliable sources
Content Analysis Agent: Evaluates journalistic quality and completeness
Semantic Analysis Agent: Categorizes content by Canadian political relevance
Benefits of Custom Agent Orchestration:
Transparency: Complete visibility into each agent's decision-making process
Canadian Context: Specialized knowledge of Canadian political landscape
Educational Value: Users can see exactly how each analysis is performed
Journalistic Standards: Agents follow professional journalism criteria
Bias Accountability: Clear tracking of potential biases in analysis
