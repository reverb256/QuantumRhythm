His outfit blends scholarly elegance with a rebellious edge, fitting his “blasphemer” moniker.[](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Anaxa)[](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Anaxa/Lore)

#### Personality
Anaxa is a complex figure defined by his relentless pursuit of truth and defiance of established norms:
- **Intellectual and Defiant**: As one of the Seven Sages of the Grove of Epiphany and founder of the Nousporists, Anaxa challenges the Coreflame of Reason, a divine force tied to the Aeon Nous. He rejects prophecy and dogma, proclaiming, “In a world full of lies, I am the only truth.”[](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Anaxa)[](https://starrailstation.com/en/character/anaxa)
- **Stern and Commanding**: He insists on being called Anaxagoras, not Anaxa, and demands silence from others, reflecting his authoritative demeanor. His rules—“Do not call me Anaxa” and “Never interrupt me — silence is golden”—highlight his need for control and focus.[](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Anaxa)[](https://x.com/honkaistarrail/status/1889524837657235465)
- **Tragic and Self-Sacrificing**: Beneath his arrogance lies a deep sense of duty. Anaxa is willing to sacrifice himself for his ideals and others, as seen in his actions during the Grove’s fall.[](https://x.com/CEOofAnaxa/status/1918181903649390989)
- **Mentor Figure**: He takes pride in teaching, finding joy when students ask questions, and views his legacy as a torch to be passed on, even at the cost of his life.[](https://starrailstation.com/en/character/anaxa)[](https://x.com/CEOofAnaxa/status/1918181903649390989)

#### Gameplay Mechanics
Anaxa is a versatile 5-star Wind Erudition character, excelling in area-of-effect (AoE) damage and utility through weakness implantation. His kit makes him a game-changer in team compositions, functioning as either a hypercarry DPS or a sub-DPS/support. Key aspects include:

- **Basic Attack**: Deals Wind damage to a single target, with an additional 10 Energy regeneration at higher trace levels. Rarely used, as his Skill and Ultimate are prioritized.[](https://genshin.gg/star-rail/characters/anaxa/)[](https://www.eurogamer.net/honkai-star-rail-anaxa-materials-ascension-traces-kit-eidolons)
- **Skill**: Deals Wind damage to a primary target, then bounces to random enemies (up to four times), prioritizing unhit targets. Each enemy on the field increases damage by 20%. It also reduces enemy DEF by 16% for two turns and recovers one Skill Point on first use.[](https://www.thegamer.com/honkai-star-rail-anaxa-build-teams-light-cone-relic-how-to-play-guide/)[](https://genshin.gg/star-rail/characters/anaxa/)
- **Ultimate**: Inflicts the “Sublimation” state, applying all seven elemental weaknesses (Physical, Fire, Ice, Lightning, Wind, Quantum, Imaginary) to all enemies until their next turn. Enemies without Control RES are immobilized. Deals 80–200% of Anaxa’s ATK as Wind damage.[](https://lootbar.gg/blog/en/honkai-star-rail-anaxa-kit.html)[](https://genshin.gg/star-rail/characters/anaxa/)
- **Talent (Tetrad Wisdom Reigns Thrice)**: Each attack inflicts a random weakness type (lasting three turns), prioritizing types the enemy lacks. Enemies with five or more weaknesses enter the “Qualitative Disclosure” state, taking 18–30% more damage from Anaxa. Attacking these enemies grants an additional Skill use without consuming Skill Points.[](https://lootbar.gg/blog/en/honkai-star-rail-anaxa-build-guide.html)[](https://genshin.gg/star-rail/characters/anaxa/)
- **Technique (Pupil of Prism)**: Inflicts the “Terrified” state on enemies in a set area, causing them to flee for 10 seconds. Attacking Terrified enemies counts as hitting a weakness, and Anaxa applies a weakness matching the attacker’s damage type for three turns.[](https://beebom.com/honkai-star-rail-anaxa-kit-build-materials/)[](https://genshin.gg/star-rail/characters/anaxa/)
- **Trace (Imperative Hiatus)**: Grants flexibility based on team composition:
  - One Erudition character: +140% CRIT DMG for Anaxa (hypercarry build).
  - Two or more Erudition characters: +50% DMG for all allies (dual-DPS build with The Herta).[](https://genshin.gg/star-rail/characters/anaxa/)[](https://gamerant.com/honkai-star-rail-hsr-anaxa-build-guide-best-relic-light-cone/)
- **Eidolons**:
  - **E1 (Magician, Isolated by Stars)**: Recovers one Skill Point after first Skill use and applies 16% DEF reduction.
  - **E2 (Soul, True to History)**: Triggers Talent’s weakness implant and reduces All-Type RES by 20% when enemies enter the battlefield.
  - **E6 (Everything Is in Everything)**: Boosts damage to 130% and makes Imperative Hiatus effects independent of Erudition character count.[](https://www.eurogamer.net/honkai-star-rail-anaxa-materials-ascension-traces-kit-eidolons)
- **Signature Light Cone (Life Should Be Cast to Flames)**: Increases CRIT Rate by 18%, regenerates 10 Energy per turn, boosts damage by 60–100% against enemies with implanted weaknesses, and reduces enemy DEF by 12–24% for two turns.[](https://lootbar.gg/blog/en/honkai-star-rail-anaxa-build-guide.html)[](https://lootbar.gg/blog/en/honkai-star-rail-anaxa-kit.html)
- **Recommended Relics**:
  - **Genius of Brilliant Stars**: Ignores 20% enemy DEF when Quantum weakness is applied (synergizes with Anaxa’s weakness implantation).
  - **Scholar Lost in Erudition**: Boosts CRIT Rate and Skill/Ultimate damage.
  - **Eagle of Twilight Line**: Increases Wind damage and advances action after Ultimate (ideal for dual-DPS with The Herta).[](https://lootbar.gg/blog/en/honkai-star-rail-anaxa-build-guide.html)[](https://gamerant.com/honkai-star-rail-hsr-anaxa-build-guide-best-relic-light-cone/)
- **Planar Ornaments**:
  - **Izumo Gensei and Takama Divine Realm**: Enhances CRIT stats.
  - **Rutilant Arena**: Boosts CRIT Rate and Skill damage.[](https://beebom.com/honkai-star-rail-anaxa-kit-build-materials/)
- **Stat Priorities**: 100% CRIT Rate, 160% CRIT DMG, 134–161 Speed, ATK%.[](https://beebom.com/honkai-star-rail-anaxa-kit-build-materials/)

Anaxa’s ability to implant weaknesses across all enemies makes him a “better Silver Wolf” for AoE scenarios, enhancing team flexibility and synergy with characters like The Herta, Tribbie, or supports like Sunday and Robin.[](https://screenrant.com/honkai-star-rail-32-leaks-anaxa-path-erudition/)[](https://gamerant.com/honkai-star-rail-leak-anaxa-path-abilities/)

#### Background
Anaxa hails from the Grove of Epiphany, a hub of knowledge and philosophy on the planet Amphoreus, inspired by Greek mythology. He is one of the Chrysos Heirs, heroes tasked with reclaiming the Titans’ Coreflames to save Amphoreus from ruin. His Divine Authority is tied to Cerces, one of the Three Titans of Creation, who holds the Coreflame of Reason and manifested Amphoreus as a sacred tree. Anaxa’s philosophy, rooted in the Nousporists, questions the divine prophecies and the Coreflame’s authority, earning him the title “blasphemer.”[](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Anaxa)[](https://gamerant.com/honkai-star-rail-anaxa-leaks-rumors-release-kit-lore/)

Born in a remote city-state, Anaxa’s early life was marked by tragedy. His parents died young, leaving him and his older sister to survive on her meager income from taming animals. Isolated and reclusive, Anaxa was bullied and found solace in crafting, such as creating a mechanical bird and developing new life through incubation. His sister made him a dromas doll, a keepsake from their family’s pet, symbolizing their bond. Eventually, she sent him to the Grove of Epiphany, where he rose to become one of its Seven Sages.[](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Anaxa/Lore)[](https://starrailstation.com/en/character/anaxa)[](https://x.com/kamiikyou/status/1909180372568453514)

### Story (Spoiler-Heavy)

**WARNING**: The following section contains major spoilers for Anaxa’s story, drawn from official sources, leaks, and fan discussions. It covers events up to Version 3.3 and includes speculative elements where details are incomplete. Proceed at your own risk.

#### The Grove of Epiphany and the Nousporists
Anaxa’s story begins in the Grove of Epiphany, where he establishes the Nousporists, a faction dedicated to pursuing truth through reason, challenging the divine authority of the Coreflame of Reason. As a Chrysos Heir, his mission is to confront the Titans and retrieve their Coreflames to prevent Amphoreus’s collapse. However, his skepticism leads him to question the prophecy itself, viewing it as a lie in a “world full of lies.” His ultimate goal is to prove his theory that truth lies beyond divine control, even if it means defying the gods and embracing infamy.[](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Anaxa)[](https://starrailstation.com/en/character/anaxa)

In the Trailblaze Mission *Scholar, Let Us Meet Again Before the Gates of Truth*, Anaxa removes the Reason Coreflame from his body, a radical act that symbolizes his rejection of divine authority. This action, however, leads to his fading away, suggesting a severe physical or spiritual cost. His defiance is both philosophical and personal, as he seeks to forge the Coreflames into a vessel to challenge the gods, declaring, “My body shall become the vessel to forge the Coreflames of gods, and my soul shall become the chains that force the gods to bow.”[](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Anaxa)[](https://starrailstation.com/en/character/anaxa)

#### Sacrifice and the Fall of the Grove
The Grove of Epiphany faces a catastrophic attack by the Flame Reaver, a destructive force tied to Amphoreus’s downfall. Anaxa sacrifices himself to protect others during this assault, demonstrating his selflessness despite his stern demeanor. In a poignant act, he gives his “heart” (possibly metaphorical or literal, tied to the Coreflame) to Castorice, another Chrysos Heir, transforming it into a stone to help her find her sister. This act is framed as his final lesson to her, emphasizing his role as a mentor who values his students’ growth above his own survival.[](https://x.com/CEOofAnaxa/status/1918181903649390989)

His sacrifice is not in vain but comes at the cost of his existence. An echo in his memories, discovered after the Grove’s fall, reveals his final thoughts: “My future students, if you see these words, it proves that my endeavor has failed at the final step, falling just before the break of dawn. Use my results to the fullest extent, and make me the subject of your research! Step over my body and take the torch from my hands.” This message underscores his willingness to be a stepping stone for others, urging them to continue his pursuit of truth.[](https://starrailstation.com/en/character/anaxa)

#### Relationships and Tragedy
Anaxa’s story is intertwined with other Chrysos Heirs, notably Aglaea, with whom he shares a complex, doomed relationship. Fan works suggest a forbidden romance marked by secret meetings and emotional turmoil, strained by Aglaea’s role as a demigod-like figure under the prophecy’s sway. Their bond, once deep, is fractured by time and duty, with Aglaea mourning a hollow connection in later encounters.[](https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Anaxa%2520%28Honkai:%2520Star%2520Rail%29/works)

Additionally, Anaxa’s relationship with Phainon, another Chrysos Heir, is explored in fan narratives. Their dynamic ranges from mentorship to potential romance, with Phainon as Anaxa’s best student. These stories often highlight Anaxa’s tragic arc, with themes of betrayal, love, and loss, though they remain speculative and not fully canon.[](https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Anaxa%2As%2APhainon%2520%28Honkai:%2520Star%2520Rail%29/works)

#### The Chrysos Heirs’ Fate
By Version 3.3, the Trailblaze Mission reveals a grim fate for the Chrysos Heirs. Most, including Anaxa, are dead or no longer exist, with only Phainon and Cerydra surviving. The Flame Reaver is implicated as a central cause of their demise, suggesting Anaxa’s sacrifice was part of a larger, tragic saga. His actions, however, leave a lasting impact, as Castorice uses his gift to continue her journey, and his teachings inspire others to challenge the prophecy.[](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/f/t/Anaxa)

#### Legacy
Anaxa’s story is one of intellectual rebellion, sacrifice, and mentorship. His pursuit of truth, even at the cost of his life, positions him as a tragic hero whose legacy endures through his students and the Nousporists. His final echo—urging others to use his failure as fuel for progress—reflects his belief that transcending the gods is a sin worth committing. The unresolved dots in the Trailblazer’s book suggest his story may have additional revelations, potentially tied to the cycles of Amphoreus or the Titan’s power.[](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/f/t/Anaxa)

### Innovative Ideas and Context
As an intermediate Linux administrator, you might appreciate a metaphorical parallel between Anaxa’s story and system administration principles:
- **Pursuit of Truth as Debugging**: Anaxa’s relentless questioning of prophecy mirrors debugging a complex system. Just as he challenges the Coreflame, you might approach a misconfigured server by questioning assumptions and digging into logs to uncover root causes.
- **Sacrifice as Resource Allocation**: His sacrifice for the Grove parallels prioritizing critical system resources during a crisis (e.g., shutting down non-essential services to maintain uptime). An OWASP-inspired approach to his story would involve securing his “system” (the Grove) against threats like the Flame Reaver, perhaps by implementing redundancy or fail-safes.
- **Mentorship as Knowledge Transfer**: Anaxa’s teaching reflects documentation and training in Linux environments, ensuring knowledge persists beyond his “uptime.” You could emulate this by creating idempotent scripts for system tasks, ensuring consistency and reproducibility—much like his torch-passing to students.

If you’re interested in a technical spin, I could generate a chart visualizing Anaxa’s damage output or team synergy metrics, or propose a bash script inspired by his philosophy (e.g., a “truth-seeker” script to audit system configurations). Let me know if you’d like to explore these!
