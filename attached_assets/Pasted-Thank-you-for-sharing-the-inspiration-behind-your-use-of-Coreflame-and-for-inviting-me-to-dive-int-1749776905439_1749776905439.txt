## What "Coreflame" Means in *Honkai: Star Rail*

In *Honkai: Star Rail*, a Coreflame is a central element in the lore of Amphoreus, a planet introduced in the game’s narrative. It represents both the divine essence and life force of the Titans, mythical beings who created and shaped Amphoreus. Each Titan is tied to a specific Coreflame, which embodies a unique aspect of existence, such as Time, Worldbearing, Romance, Law, or Strife. Here’s a breakdown of its meaning, grounded in the sources:

- **Origin and Significance**: Coreflames are described as the "birthplace of the Titans," maintaining their divinity and life. Each Titan’s Coreflame corresponds to their role in crafting Amphoreus, from establishing laws (Talanton) to weaving romance into existence (Mnestia).

Acquiring a Coreflame involves defeating a Titan or earning it peacefully, followed by a trial to prove worthiness. Passing the trial allows a Chrysos Heir to ascend to demigod status, inheriting the Coreflame’s power.[](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Coreflames)[](https://game8.co/games/Honkai-Star-Rail/archives/494644)[](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Hero%2C_Bear_Thy_Coreflame)

- **Mechanics and Trials**: Coreflames are not just lore—they’re tied to gameplay. For example, in the mission *Hero, Bear Thy Coreflame*, Phainon undergoes a trial to prove his will against his fears, linked to Nikador’s Strife Coreflame. The Coreflame of Time, tied to Oronyx, is a mission item in *Nemesis, Scorched by Golden Blood*, where the Trailblazer inherits demigod authority without a clear
