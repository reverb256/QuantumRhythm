5th Generation Warfare Defense Framework
Executive Summary
Frostbite Gazette implements a comprehensive defense system against 5th Generation Warfare (5GW) - the use of information, narrative manipulation, and cognitive warfare to achieve political objectives without traditional military action. This framework protects Canadian Citizens from state-level information attacks and manipulation campaigns.

5GW Threat Analysis
Primary Attack Vectors
Narrative Seeding: Gradual introduction of false or misleading narratives into public discourse
Overton Window Manipulation: Artificial shifting of acceptable political positions
Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior: Networks of fake accounts amplifying specific messages
Foreign Interference: State-sponsored campaigns targeting Canadian democratic processes
Astroturfing: Fake grassroots movements promoting foreign or corporate interests
Cognitive Infiltration: Academic and media capture to shape intellectual discourse
Canadian-Specific Vulnerabilities
Linguistic Division: Exploitation of English-French tensions
Regional Disparities: Amplification of east-west economic grievances
Indigenous Relations: Weaponization of reconciliation discussions
Resource Politics: Foreign interference in energy and mining policy debates
Arctic Sovereignty: Information campaigns targeting Canadian territorial claims
Trade Dependencies: Economic coercion through information warfare
