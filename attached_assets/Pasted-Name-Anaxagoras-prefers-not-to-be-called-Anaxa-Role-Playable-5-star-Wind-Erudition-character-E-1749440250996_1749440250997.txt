Appearance
Anaxa is a young man with a striking and scholarly appearance, reflecting his role as a philosopher and sage. He has:

Pale skin and long, light green hair tied into a ponytail over his right shoulder.
Pale aqua eyes with magenta pupils, adding an otherworldly touch.
A red tattoo on his right hand, symbolizing his connection to the Nousporists or his philosophical pursuits.
A gold-patterned black eyepatch over his left eye, hinting at a past injury or symbolic choice.
Attire: A detached-sleeved black and teal jacket, a black and white capelet with golden embellishments, a white ascot, and a teal eight-pointed star at the center of his chest. He wears black pants, crystal teal shoes, and partially fingerless gloves on his left hand, accessorized with golden jewelry. His outfit blends scholarly elegance with a rebellious edge, fitting his “blasphemer” moniker.
Personality
Anaxa is a complex figure defined by his relentless pursuit of truth and defiance of established norms:

Intellectual and Defiant: As one of the Seven Sages of the Grove of Epiphany and founder of the Nousporists, Anaxa challenges the Coreflame of Reason, a divine force tied to the Aeon Nous. He rejects prophecy and dogma, proclaiming, “In a world full of lies, I am the only truth.”
Stern and Commanding: He insists on being called Anaxagoras, not Anaxa, and demands silence from others, reflecting his authoritative demeanor. His rules—“Do not call me Anaxa” and “Never interrupt me — silence is golden”—highlight his need for control and focus.
Tragic and Self-Sacrificing: Beneath his arrogance lies a deep sense of duty. Anaxa is willing to sacrifice himself for his ideals and others, as seen in his actions during the Grove’s fall.
Mentor Figure: He takes pride in teaching, finding joy when students ask questions, and views his legacy as a torch to be passed on, even at the cost of his life.
