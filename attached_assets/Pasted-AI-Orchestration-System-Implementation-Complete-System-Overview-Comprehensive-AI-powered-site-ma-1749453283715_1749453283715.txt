AI Orchestration System - Implementation Complete
System Overview
Comprehensive AI-powered site management system integrated with Workplace Janitorial Services website, featuring local command parsing and real-time content modification capabilities.

Core Features Implemented
1. Local AI Command Processing
Pattern-based parsing: Natural language command recognition without external APIs
Target detection: Automatically identifies page sections (hero, services, contact, etc.)
Action classification: Recognizes update, add, remove, and styling operations
Parameter extraction: Parses content, phone numbers, emails from commands
2. Database Schema
-- AI Commands tracking
ai_commands (id, admin_id, command, target, action, parameters, status, result, created_at, executed_at)
-- Site content versioning
site_content (id, section_id, content, metadata, version, is_active, updated_by, updated_at)
3. Admin Control Panel
Floating access button: Discrete bottom-right corner placement
Natural language interface: Command input with examples
Real-time feedback: Command history and execution status
Content versioning: Track all site modifications
Visual capabilities grid: Available AI functions display
4. API Endpoints
POST /api/admin/ai-command     - Execute natural language commands
GET  /api/admin/ai-commands    - Retrieve command history
GET  /api/admin/site-content   - View content versions
5. Enhanced Visual Design
Deeper accent colors: Darker spectrum implementation (blues: #004D7A, cyans: #00838F, teals: #00695C)
Harmonized containers: Updated background gradients and shadows
Professional underglow: Enhanced animation effects
Command Examples
