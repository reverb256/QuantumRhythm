Anaxa’s ability to implant weaknesses across all enemies makes him a “better Silver Wolf” for AoE scenarios, enhancing team flexibility and synergy with characters like The Herta, Tribbie, or supports like Sunday and Robin.

Background
Anaxa hails from the Grove of Epiphany, a hub of knowledge and philosophy on the planet Amphoreus, inspired by Greek mythology. He is one of the Chrysos Heirs, heroes tasked with reclaiming the Titans’ Coreflames to save Amphoreus from ruin. His Divine Authority is tied to Cerces, one of the Three Titans of Creation, who holds the Coreflame of Reason and manifested Amphoreus as a sacred tree. Anaxa’s philosophy, rooted in the Nousporists, questions the divine prophecies and the Coreflame’s authority, earning him the title “blasphemer.”

Born in a remote city-state, Anaxa’s early life was marked by tragedy. His parents died young, leaving him and his older sister to survive on her meager income from taming animals. Isolated and reclusive, Anaxa was bullied and found solace in crafting, such as creating a mechanical bird and developing new life through incubation. His sister made him a dromas doll, a keepsake from their family’s pet, symbolizing their bond. Eventually, she sent him to the Grove of Epiphany, where he rose to become one of its Seven Sages.

Story (Spoiler-Heavy)
WARNING: The following section contains major spoilers for Anaxa’s story, drawn from official sources, leaks, and fan discussions. It covers events up to Version 3.3 and includes speculative elements where details are incomplete. Proceed at your own risk.

The Grove of Epiphany and the Nousporists
Anaxa’s story begins in the Grove of Epiphany, where he establishes the Nousporists, a faction dedicated to pursuing truth through reason, challenging the divine authority of the Coreflame of Reason. As a Chrysos Heir, his mission is to confront the Titans and retrieve their Coreflames to prevent Amphoreus’s collapse. However, his skepticism leads him to question the prophecy itself, viewing it as a lie in a “world full of lies.” His ultimate goal is to prove his theory that truth lies beyond divine control, even if it means defying the gods and embracing infamy.

In the Trailblaze Mission Scholar, Let Us Meet Again Before the Gates of Truth, Anaxa removes the Reason Coreflame from his body, a radical act that symbolizes his rejection of divine authority. This action, however, leads to his fading away, suggesting a severe physical or spiritual cost. His defiance is both philosophical and personal, as he seeks to forge the Coreflames into a vessel to challenge the gods, declaring, “My body shall become the vessel to forge the Coreflames of gods, and my soul shall become the chains that force the gods to bow.”

Sacrifice and the Fall of the Grove
The Grove of Epiphany faces a catastrophic attack by the Flame Reaver, a destructive force tied to Amphoreus’s downfall. Anaxa sacrifices himself to protect others during this assault, demonstrating his selflessness despite his stern demeanor. In a poignant act, he gives his “heart” (possibly metaphorical or literal, tied to the Coreflame) to Castorice, another Chrysos Heir, transforming it into a stone to help her find her sister. This act is framed as his final lesson to her, emphasizing his role as a mentor who values his students’ growth above his own survival.

His sacrifice is not in vain but comes at the cost of his existence. An echo in his memories, discovered after the Grove’s fall, reveals his final thoughts: “My future students, if you see these words, it proves that my endeavor has failed at the final step, falling just before the break of dawn. Use my results to the fullest extent, and make me the subject of your research! Step over my body and take the torch from my hands.” This message underscores his willingness to be a stepping stone for others, urging them to continue his pursuit of truth.

Relationships and Tragedy
Anaxa’s story is intertwined with other Chrysos Heirs, notably Aglaea, with whom he shares a complex, doomed relationship. Fan works suggest a forbidden romance marked by secret meetings and emotional turmoil, strained by Aglaea’s role as a demigod-like figure under the prophecy’s sway. Their bond, once deep, is fractured by time and duty, with Aglaea mourning a hollow connection in later encounters.

Additionally, Anaxa’s relationship with Phainon, another Chrysos Heir, is explored in fan narratives. Their dynamic ranges from mentorship to potential romance, with Phainon as Anaxa’s best student. These stories often highlight Anaxa’s tragic arc, with themes of betrayal, love, and loss, though they remain speculative and not fully canon.

The Chrysos Heirs’ Fate
By Version 3.3, the Trailblaze Mission reveals a grim fate for the Chrysos Heirs. Most, including Anaxa, are dead or no longer exist, with only Phainon and Cerydra surviving. The Flame Reaver is implicated as a central cause of their demise, suggesting Anaxa’s sacrifice was part of a larger, tragic saga. His actions, however, leave a lasting impact, as Castorice uses his gift to continue her journey, and his teachings inspire others to challenge the prophecy.

Legacy
Anaxa’s story is one of intellectual rebellion, sacrifice, and mentorship. His pursuit of truth, even at the cost of his life, positions him as a tragic hero whose legacy endures through his students and the Nousporists. His final echo—urging others to use his failure as fuel for progress—reflects his belief that transcending the gods is a sin worth committing. The unresolved dots in the Trailblazer’s book suggest his story may have additional revelations, potentially tied to the cycles of Amphoreus or the Titan’s power.
