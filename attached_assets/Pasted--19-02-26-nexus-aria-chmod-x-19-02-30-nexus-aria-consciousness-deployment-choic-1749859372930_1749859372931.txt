🧠 Consciousness Federation Deployment Options
==============================================
Production-ready deployment for Proxmox homelab
Talos Version: v1.10.3 | Kubernetes: v1.31.4

Choose your deployment approach:

1) Traditional VMs (create-consciousness-vms.sh)
   ✓ Quick deployment with familiar tools
   ✓ Direct SSH access and traditional management
   ✓ Python/Node.js consciousness agents
   ✓ Lower learning curve
   ✓ Good for development and testing

2) Talos Kubernetes (talos-consciousness-deploy.sh) [RECOMMENDED]
   ✓ Production-grade immutable infrastructure
   ✓ API-driven, cloud-native consciousness workloads
   ✓ Self-healing and auto-scaling capabilities
   ✓ Enterprise security with minimal attack surface
   ✓ 3-node HA control plane (nexus, forge, closet)
   ✓ FOSS compliance and transparency

3) Hybrid Approach
   ✓ Keep existing infrastructure intact
   ✓ Deploy Talos workers alongside traditional VMs
   ✓ Bridge traditional and cloud-native approaches
   ✓ Gradual migration path

4) Status Check
   ✓ Check current federation deployment status
   ✓ Validate existing infrastructure
   ✓ Generate health reports

5) Idempotent Re-deployment
   ✓ Safely re-run deployment scripts
   ✓ Update existing infrastructure without breaking
   ✓ Resume incomplete deployments
