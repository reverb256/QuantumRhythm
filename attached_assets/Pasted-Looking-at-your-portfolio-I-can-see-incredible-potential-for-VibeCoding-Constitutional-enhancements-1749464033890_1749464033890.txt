Looking at your existing codebase, you already have a sophisticated SEO foundation that could absolutely be enhanced with AI management! Let me break down what you have and how AI can take it to the next level:

Current SEO Infrastructure âœ…
From your seo-head.tsx, you already have:

Dynamic meta tag management
Schema markup generation
