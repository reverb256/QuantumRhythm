### Appearance
- **Description**: A fair-skinned young woman with light pink hair tied in a long ponytail with a blue streak. Wears a knotted white crop-top with graffiti design, a black cropped fishnet top, a short red jacket with a flame-patterned flag, short black shorts with a spray paint can on a white belt, and black open-toe boots. Her toes have black nail polish, and she wields a chakram shaped like a shuriken.
- **Design Notes**: Her outfit reflects her ninja aesthetic mixed with modern street culture (rap, graffiti, manga), emphasizing her rebellious and artistic personality.

### Personality
- **Quirks**: Self-proclaimed "Cosmic Ninja" who attributes everything to "ninjutsu." Obsessed with ninja culture, she incorporates rap, graffiti, and manga into her "Way of the Ninja."
- **Backstory Influence**: Infected by a memetic virus that alters her perception, making her view her life as a ninja saga set in a neon-lit "Ninja Capital" (Laboratory 17). She can speak normally when reminded of her past but reverts to ninja-speak otherwise.
- **Mission**: As a Galaxy Ranger, she pursues the "Evil Ninja Osaru" across the cosmos, driven by a sense of justice and righteousness through rigorous self-discipline.
- **Humor and Depth**: Her eccentric ninja persona hides a tragic backstory as a lab-created being, adding depth to her quirky demeanor.

### Gameplay Mechanics
- **Role**: AoE Break DPS, excelling in multi-target scenarios like Pure Fiction. Specializes in Break Damage, Super Break, and Exo-Toughness mechanics.
- **Basic Attack**: Deals Imaginary damage to one enemy (50% of ATK at max level).
- **Skill (Ninja Strike: Rooted Resolute)**: Deals Imaginary damage to all enemies (120% of ATK at Level 10). If an enemy is Weakness Broken, deals additional Break Damage and bounces to other enemies.
- **Ultimate (Nindō Supreme: Aishiteru)**: Enters "Sealform" state, gaining an extra turn, 3 Chroma Ink points, +50% Weakness Break Efficiency, and +10% Break Effect. Enhances Basic Attack to "Ningu: Demonbane Petalblade," with three hits:
  - First two hits: Imaginary damage to one enemy (60% of ATK) and adjacent targets (30% of ATK).
  - Third hit: Imaginary damage to all enemies (60% of ATK), with additional Break Damage (30% of Imaginary Break DMG, scaled by Charge stacks).
  - Ignores Weakness Types for Toughness reduction (50% of original).
- **Talent (Ninja Tech: Endurance Gauge)**: Gains 1 Charge per Weakness Break (up to 10). Each Charge boosts Break Damage and Toughness reduction. Elite enemy breaks grant +1 Charge and 10 Energy.
- **Technique (Graffiti State)**: Summons a surfboard for rapid movement, dealing 30 Toughness reduction and 200% Imaginary Break Damage (180% to adjacent targets) upon entering combat. Blocks enemy attacks during movement.
- **Eidolons**:
  - **E1**: Increases Toughness reduction for first two hits of Enhanced Basic Attack by 50%.
  - **E2**: +12% SPD for allies in Sealform state.
  - **E6**: Converts Enhanced Basic Attack damage to 60% Super Break Damage against Weakness Broken enemies.
- **Recommended Relics**:
  - **Iron Cavalry Against the Scourge**: +16% Break Effect, +20% when SPD ≥145.
  - **Forge of the Kalpagni Lantern**: +6% SPD, +40% Break Effect for one turn against Fire-weak enemies.
- **Stat Priorities**: 250% Break Effect, 3200 ATK, 145+ SPD.
- **Team Synergy**: Best with Harmony Trailblazer (Super Break DMG), Ruan Mei (Break Effect, Weakness Break extension), and Lingsha (AoE healing, Break Damage boost). Gallagher with Quid Pro Quo Light Cone aids Energy regeneration.
- **Strengths**: High AoE Break Damage, ignores Weakness Types for Toughness reduction, excels in Pure Fiction. Struggles against single-target Elite enemies compared to Firefly or Boothill.

## Innovative Ideas for Linux Admins
- **Ninja Automation**: Rappa’s “Dazzling Ninja Seals” inspire a bash script to audit system vulnerabilities, akin to her pursuit of justice:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  # Rappa-inspired system audit script (idempotent)
  LOG_FILE="/var/log/ninja_audit.log"
  echo "Rappa's Ninja Audit: Scanning system..." | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"
  if ! command -v nmap >/dev/null; then sudo apt-get install -y nmap; fi
  nmap -sV --open 127.0.0.1 | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"
  echo "Audit complete. Check $LOG_FILE for weaknesses!" | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"
